## <a name="sec0"></a>Previous/Next extent

After panning or zooming the map, the function **_Previous extent_** allows the user to return to the previously visible map extent. Similarly the function **_Next extent_** allows to move forward in the extent history.


## <a name="sec1"></a>New map window

The **_New map window_** function opens up additional map views. These can be placed anywhere within the main window or decoupled from it by dragging the title bar.

In the subwindow views, you can enable and disable layers independently from the main view. The visible extent can be controlled independently of the main view or synchronized by toggling the lock icon in the title bar of the subwindow.

In map window only the navigation tool is available, all other tools can only be used in the main view.

The title of the subwindow can be changed if necessary.

## <a name="sec2"></a>3D

The **_3D_** function opens an additional child window with a 3D globe view. It can be moved around within or outside the application window by dragging on their title bar.

### Settings

The displayed layers can be toggled from the secondary view window title bar.


+ **Synchronize extent**: The button **_Synchronize extent_** synchronizes the globe viewport with the current extent of the main map view.
+ **Reload scene**: The button **_Reload scene_** triggers a refresh of all layers displayed on the globe.
+ **Globe settings**: The button **_Globe settings_** opens the globe configuration dialog. Among other things, the terrain models for the 3D view are configured there, and imagery layers can also be added. The 2D layers to be displayed are selected in the menu on the left side of the title bar. In the interest of performance, only local layers of the 2D view are activated by default - background image layers should, if possible, be added directly as imagery layers in the globe settings dialog.

2D view planes are drawn by default as a draped textures on the globe. Vector layers (including redlining) can alternatively be drawn either as extruded 2.5D models or as 3D models, with the style of the 2D view adopted as much as possible in the 3D view. For representation as 3D models, the geometries of the layer must be provided with elevation information (Z coordinates), and these must be either expressed with respect to the terrain or the sea level. The display options for vector levels can be set in the corresponding layer properties.


> The tooltips of the input fields in the globe settings of the layer describe the various options in detail.

> The shading of 3D models depends on the position of the sun. The position of the sun can be controlled by specifying time and date in the globe settings.

Pins, camera images and one-point MSS symbols are displayed as billboards.


### Navigation

+ **Camera position navigation**: The upper navigation wheel allows the user to modify the horizontal and vertical viewing angles of the camera.
+ **Navigation auf Globus**: The lower navigation wheel allows the user to pan around the globe. The same can be accomplished by pressing the keyboard arrows.
+ **+**: Reduces the camera height from the globe surface.
+ **-**: Increases the camera distance from the globe surface.


## <a name="sec3"></a>Grid

The map **_grid_** can be activated in the View tab. The grid is based on the chosen map coordinate system.
