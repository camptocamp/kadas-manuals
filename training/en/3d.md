# Multiple map windows and 3D view

## Multiple map windows

In the *View* tab, new map sub-windows can be opened. These can be placed anywhere within the main window or decoupled from it by dragging the title bar.

In the subwindow views, you can enable and disable layers independently from the main view. The visible extent can be controlled independently of the main view or synchronized by toggling the lock icon in the title bar of the subwindow.

In map window only the navigation tool is available, all other tools can only be used in the main view.

The title of the subwindow can be changed if necessary.

## 3D view

Also in the *View* tab  the 3D view can be activated. This subwindow can also be freely arranged.

In the 3D view, a globe is displayed. The view can be controlled both by mouse movements and by operating the control elements in the upper left window area. In the title bar the view can be synchronized with the main map window.

The globe settings dialog can be opened also from the title bar. Among other things, the terrain models for the 3D view are configured there, and imagery layers can also be added. The 2D layers to be displayed are selected in the menu on the left side of the title bar. In the interest of performance, only local layers of the 2D view are activated by default - background image layers should, if possible, be added directly as imagery layers in the globe settings dialog.

2D view planes are drawn by default as a draped textures on the globe. Vector layers (including redlining) can alternatively be drawn either as extruded 2.5D models or as 3D models, with the style of the 2D view adopted as much as possible in the 3D view. For representation as 3D models, the geometries of the layer must be provided with elevation information (Z coordinates), and these must be either expressed with respect to the terrain or the sea level. The display options for vector levels can be set in the corresponding layer properties.

*Note*: The tooltips of the input fields in the globe settings of the layer describe the various options in detail.

*Note*: The shading of 3D models depends on the position of the sun. The position of the sun can be controlled by specifying time and date in the globe settings.

Pins, camera images and one-point MSS symbols are displayed as billboards.
