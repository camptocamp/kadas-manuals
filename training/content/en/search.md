# Search and pins

## Search

The search field provides a unified interface for various search services:

- Coordinates (LV03, LV95, DD, DM, DMS, UTM, MGRS)

- Locations and addresses throughout Switzerland

- Towns worldwide

- Attributes in local layers

- Attributes in remote layers (web services)

- Attributes in pins

After entering at least three letters, the search starts and results are displayed.

The results are listed in correspondingly designated categories. The result list can be searched with mouse or keyboard arrows. When selecting a result with the arrows, a blue pin is placed in the appropriate location. When activating a result with the mouse, the map section is centered on the corresponding location.

To the right of the search field, it is possible to define a filter geometry for local and remote data set search. This filter is not used for coordinates, location or pin searches.

## Pins {# map-pins}

The pin placement tool is located in the *Drawing* tab. Position and height can be read in the tooltip of a placed pin. A double-click on the pin opens its attribute dialog. Web links can be copied to the text box from a web browser. By right-clicking on the pin, its position can be copied to the clipboard.
